## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Describe the benefits of randomly assigning participants to treatment groups.


## Drawing Causal Conclusions from a Study {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## When can we make a causal claim?

- In a lot of research we are interested in making a causal claim.
  + **Example:** This curriculum improved learning!
- To be able to make this claim we need to be confident there aren't any other factors that actually influenced the outcome!


## When can we make a causal claim? 

To mitigate uncertainty about external factors we want to compare equivalent groups. {.v-center-container}


## Ideally...

We have two identical groups (think identical twins). One group is given the treatment and the other isn't (the control group---often given a placebo). That is the only difference between them.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("figs/13-01-identical-groups.png")
```

If there is a difference between the groups in the end, we can be confident it was from the treatment!


## Identical Groups?

- We can't create identical groups ... necessarily.
- Instead, we create *probabilistically equivalent* groups.
  + a.k.a. Mathematically equivalent groups
- These groups are, on average, the SAME on all characteristics (observable and not observable).
- To do this we randomly assign people to be in the treatment group and the control/placebo group.
- You will explore this in an activity!

## Random Assignment

- The process of random assignment creates, on average, groups that are "identical".
- It doesn't do this perfectly every time we create groups, but on average it does---and that is good enough!
- Creating groups through <mark>random assignment is the gold standard</mark> for making causal claims.
- There are more advanced methods, but we won't get to those in this course.


## Can you make a causal claim?

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("figs/13-02-causal-claim.png")
```


## Summary

- Randomly assigning participants to groups allows us to create groups that are probabilistically equivalent.
  + The same on average
- This allows us to infer that our treatment was the only cause of a difference between the groups (if a difference is detected).
  + Then we can make a causal claim
