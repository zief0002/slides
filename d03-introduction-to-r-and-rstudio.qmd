## Reminder

Get started on Lab Assignment #1!


## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Explain what R Studio is.  
- Explain why we use it.
- Carry out a basic workflow in R Studio for data analysis.


## Computing is fundamental to the practice of statistics and science more broadly. {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## What is R?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- R is a programming language used for statistical computing.
- It is used to write code to communicate to the computer what you want to do with your data.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-01-r-application.png")

## What is R Studio?

```{r}

```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
R Studio is an interface for programming in R.


- Allows integration of text and code to produce reports.
:::

::::


## Why R Studio?

- It's free!
- Open source
- Point and click functionality makes it more user friendly than R alone.
- Integration of code and text makes it easy to create reports
- Supports reproducibility and open science goals 


## Reproducibility

In general:

- Experiments/studies repeated with the same methods and analysis should yield the same results.

In computing:

- Code and data should be provided alongside detailed documentation of analysis so that they can be repeated with the same results.

## R Studio Pane Layout: Pane 1

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-03-r-studio-script-file.png")
```

## R Studio Pane Layout: Pane 2

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-04-r-studio-console.png")
```


## R Studio Pane Layout: Pane 3

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-05-r-studio-environment.png")
```

## R Studio Pane Layout: Pane 4

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-06-r-studio-files.png")
```


## Protip

You can change the location of the four panes by going to "Global Options > Pane Layout".



## Get the Course Data

:::sticky-note
**ONE TIME ONLY:** Download materials from the schedule page on the website.

- There is a zipped folder containing the datasets (.csv).
- Unzip the folder.
:::


## Put that folder somewhere easily accessible!

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Some suggestions:

- Desktop
- "Grad School" Folder
- On your desktop?
- In your cloud?

## Workflow (a.k.a. steps to using R Studio)

1. Load libraries (*Be sure to install any libraries you do not have.*)
2. Import data
3. Ready to perform analysis! 


## Open R Script File

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-03-r-studio-script-file.png")
```


## Now we start computing...RECALL {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}

## Functions

- To perform analyses on your data in R, you will need to use *functions*.
- Functions tell R Studio what to do with your data.
- Remember, functions have this structure: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
function_name()
```

- They contain one or more arguments, which specify options for the function.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
function_name(argument1, argument2, argument3)
```


## Libraries/Packages

- Functions live in **libraries** (a.k.a., **packages**)
- Some packages come with your R and others need to be installed. 
- Install the `{ggformula}` and `{tidyverse}` packages.

:::sticky-note
Reminder: Use the **Install** button in the **Packages tab** in RStudio.
You will only need to install the package once!
:::

---

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-08-installing-packages.png")
```


## Load a Package

- To use the functions from a particular package, we we will need to load the package (loading and installing are two different things!)
- To load the package and its functions we use the `library()` function
- You will need to load packages every time you open R Studio

---

## Load Packages (cntd.)

General Example: `library(libraryName)`

- `library()` is our function
- `libraryName` will specify the library we want to load
- To load the `{ggformula}` library we would use:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
library(ggformula)
```


---

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-09-loaded-package.png")
```

---

## Install vs. Loading

- You only need to install a package once
- But, you need to load that package every time you open a new session in RStudio. (After you load it, all the functions in the library can be used.
- Phone App analogy

---

## Importing Data

- Click `Import Dataset > From Text (readr)`
- Navigate to your dataset by clicking `Browse`

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-10-import-data.png")
```

---

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-10-02-import-data.png")
```

---

## Writing Code


```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-11-writing-code.png")
```

---

## Commenting Code

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-12-commenting-code.png")
```


## Executing Code In R Studio

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-13-running-code.png")
```
