## Reminder

Get started on Lab Assignment #1!


## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Explain what R Studio is.  
- Explain why we use it.
- Carry out a basic workflow in R Studio for data analysis.


## Computing is fundamental to the practice of statistics and science more broadly. {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## What is R?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- R is a programming language used for statistical computing.
- It is used to write code to communicate to the computer what you want to do with your data.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-01-r-application.png")
```

## What is R Studio?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-02-r-studio-application.png")
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
R Studio is an interface for programming in R.


- Allows integration of text and code to produce reports.
:::

::::


## Why R Studio?

- It's free!
- Open source
- Point and click functionality makes it more user friendly than R alone.
- Integration of code and text makes it easy to create reports
- Supports reproducibility and open science goals 


## Reproducibility

In general:

- Experiments/studies repeated with the same methods and analysis should yield the same results.

In computing:

- Code and data should be provided alongside detailed documentation of analysis so that they can be repeated with the same results.

## R Studio Pane Layout: Pane 1

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-03-r-studio-script-file.png")
```

## R Studio Pane Layout: Pane 2

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-04-r-studio-console.png")
```


## R Studio Pane Layout: Pane 3

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-05-r-studio-environment.png")
```

## R Studio Pane Layout: Pane 4

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-06-r-studio-files.png")
```


## Protip

You can change the location of the four panes by going to "Global Options > Pane Layout".



## Get the Course Data

:::sticky-note
**ONE TIME ONLY:** Download materials from the schedule page on the website.

- There is a zipped folder containing the datasets (.csv).
- Unzip the folder.
:::


## Put that folder somewhere easily accessible!

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Some suggestions:

- Desktop
- "Grad School" Folder
- On your desktop?
- In your cloud?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-07-folders.png")

## Workflow (a.k.a. steps to using R Studio)

1. Load libraries (*Be sure to install any libraries you do not have.*)
2. Import data
3. Ready to perform analysis! 


## Open R Script File

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-03-r-studio-script-file.png")
```


## Now we start computing...RECALL {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}

## Functions

- To perform analyses on your data in R, you will need to use *functions*.
- Functions tell R Studio what to do with your data.
- Remember, functions have this structure: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
function_name()
```

- They contain one or more arguments, which specify options for the function.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
function_name(argument1, argument2, argument3)
```


## Libraries/Packages

- Functions live in **libraries** (a.k.a., **packages**)
- Some packages come with your R and others need to be installed. 
- Install the `{ggformula}` and `{tidyverse}` packages.

:::sticky-note
Reminder: Use the **Install** button in the **Packages tab** in RStudio.
You will only need to install the package once!

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/03-08-installing-packages.png")
```


## Using Multiple Functions

<!-- Functions can be chained together so that the output of one function is sent to another function. -->

<!-- <br /><br /> -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #| eval: false -->
<!-- #| echo: true -->
<!-- butter_bread(type = "wheat") + -->
<!-- add_cheese(flavor = "colby") + -->
<!-- fry_sandwich(time = 6) -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ## Grilled Cheese Activity (cntd.) -->

<!-- Complete Parts 2 and 3 of the activity. -->


<!-- ## Looking Ahead -->

<!-- - We will write functions like this in class. -->
<!-- - We will use R Studio for writing and analyzing code. -->
<!-- - You will always be given functions. -->
<!-- - You will need to be precise when writing code and checking for bugs. -->
<!--   + Bugs are a normal part of the coding process! -->
