## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Identify when to answer a research question with a confidence interval.
- Explain the need for creating a confidence interval to do statistical inference.
- Know how to calculate a confidence interval by hand and using R Studio.
- Interpret a confidence interval.
- <mark>Explain how the confidence level we choose affects our interval.</mark>


## Inferential Methods

- Hypothesis Testing
  + Answers a yes/no type question
  + Example: Is the average movie length longer than 110 minutes?
- Confidence Intervals
  + Provides us an estimate taking into account uncertainty
  + Example: How long is the average movie?


## Confidence Intervals

- We have uncertainty in our sample estimates because of sampling variability (i.e., samples vary)
- We need something to quantify the uncertainty in our estimates.

â†’ Confidence Intervals


## Methodology for a Confidence Interval

$$
95\%~\text{CI} = \text{Sample Statistic} \pm \underbrace{(2 \times SE)}_{\text{Margin of Error}} 
$$
- To get a confidence interval, we add and subtract <mark>a specified number</mark> of standard errors from the sample statistic.


## Determining the SE Multiplier

- Adding and subtracting 2 standard errors gives an estimate for the margin of error.
- In practice, we determine the exact multiplier used in the margin of error by using the *t*-distribution (for CI for means)


## Use *t*-Distribution {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## Assumptions 

- Data comes from a population with a normal distribution.
- We can proceed if the distribution of the sample looks reasonably normal...OR...
  + If the sample size is large enough ($>30$; CLT)
  + In practice, better to use a simulation method to get the standard error (then we don't need to worry about sample size)
- Independence: must have independent observations


## Formula

$$
\text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm (t^* \times \text{SE})
$$

## Table 19.1 in Textbook

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("figs/18-01-ci-table.png")
```


## Formula (Update)

$$
\text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm (t^* \times \frac{\text{SD}}{\sqrt{n}})
$$


## What is $t^*$?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Recall the *t*-distribution (same one as used for *t*-test).
  + We need to know our degrees of freedom (df)
- We will use this to find the $t^*$ value based on the desired confidence level.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggprism)
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-4,4)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dt, n = 101, args = list(df = 19), color = "#621448") + 
  ylab("") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "t-value", breaks = -4:4, limits= c(-3, 3)) +
  theme_prism() +
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = 0.05, label = "t(df=19)", color = "#621448")
```

## Summary

- For a research question asking for an estimate, the best way to answer is with a confidence interval.
- The confidence interval allows us to account for uncertainty by including sampling variability in our estimate of the parameter. 
- <mark>With a higher confidence level we expect a larger confidence interval (more uncertainty in the estimate).</mark>
