## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Interpret scatterplots.
- Explain when to use correlation to explain a relationship between variables.
- Interpret a correlation.


## Scatterplots {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## Example

Say you want to use the temperature to predict coffee sales at an outdoor stadium 


```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("figs/23-01-example.png")
```


## Scatterplot

- A plot of the relationship between two quantitative variables.
  + **Explanatory variable**: The variable you want to use as a predictor (goes on *x*-axis)
  + **Response variable**: The variable you want to predict (goes on *y*-axis)


## What pattern(s) do you see?

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6
gf_point(coffee_sales ~ temperature, data = coffee, size = 3, pch = 21, color = "black", fill = "#56B4E9") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Temperature", breaks = seq(from = -20, to =70, by = 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Coffee Sales", breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 650, by = 50)) +
  theme_bw()
```

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
- Form/Trend?
- Direction?
- Strength?

:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6
gf_point(coffee_sales ~ temperature, data = coffee, size = 3, pch = 21, color = "black", fill = "#56B4E9") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Temperature", breaks = seq(from = -20, to =70, by = 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Coffee Sales", breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 650, by = 50)) +
  theme_bw()

## Correlation {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## Correlation Coefficient (r)

- Quantifies the strength and direction of linear relationship


```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("figs/23-02-correlation-coefficient.png")
```


## Car Correlation Example

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("figs/23-03-car-correlations.png")
```


## Interpreting a Correlation

- Direction: Positive or negative?
  + If **positive**: As X increases, Y tends to increase.
  + If **negative**: As X increases, Y tends to decrease.
- How strong is the linear relationship?
  + Weak (closer to 0)
  + Moderate (somewhere in the middle --- maybe $\pm.4$ to $\pm.7$)
  + Strong (closer to $\pm1$)


## Form of the Relationship?

The correlation tells us **nothing about the FORM** of the relationship.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("figs/23-04-correlation-form.png")
```


## Always Plot Your Data



:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- You should always plot your data.
- Summaries don't tell the whole story...
- All of these plots have the same mean and SD (for both X and Y) and the same correlation coefficient. 

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/23-05-same-summaries.png")
```
:::

::::


## Back to Our Example

- Correlation between temperature and coffee sales is $r=-0.741$.
- How would you interpret this correlation?


## Correlation $\neq$ CAUSATION! {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/23-06-causation-cartoon.png")
``` 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
There may be a confounding variable (a variable that impacts both the explanatory and response variables) that is explaining the relationship.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/23-07-confounding.png")
```

## Other Fun Facts about Correlation

- Correlation between X and Y = Correlation between Y and X (symmetric).
- Correlation has no units.
- If units change (e.g., kg to lbs), correlation stays the same!


## Introduction to Correlation Activity {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## Summary

- We can use a correlation to describe a linear relationship between two quantitative variables.
- A negative correlation implies a negative/indirect relationship.
- A positive correlation implies a positive/direct relationship.
- Correlation can only be between -1 and +1.
- Correlations close to -1 or +1 are strong.
- Correlations close to 0 are weak/non-existent.
