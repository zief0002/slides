## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Describe the purpose of a hypothesis test.
- List the steps of a hypothesis test.
- Describe a parametric approach to hypothesis testing for a single <mark>proportion</mark>.
- List the assumptions for using the *z*-distribution to test a single <mark>proportion</mark>.


## Purpose of Hypothesis Testing

:::{.v-center-container}
To [test a claim]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} about a [population parameter]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}
:::


## Recall: Attribute Types

- We have been working with quantitative data.
  + The population mean ($\mu$) has been our parameter of interest.
- We can also do hypothesis testing to make inferences about categorical data.
  + The population proportion ($\pi$) then becomes our parameter of interest.


## Steps of Hypothesis Testing {#sec-slide-9}

1. Formulate a **research question**
2. Write your **hypotheses**
3. <mark>Find **sampling distribution** assuming the null hypothesis is true</mark>
4. **Compare** sample summary to the distribution under the null hypothesis
5. Get a **_p_-value**
6. Make a **decision** based on the *p*-value 
7. Communicate your **conclusion** in context


## Theoretical Distribution

- Last class we used the *t*-distribution, which is appropriate for quantitative data (i.e., testing means).
- However, we will use a different distribution for categorical data (i.e., testing proportions).


## *z*-Distribution

- The *z*-distribution (a.k.a. standardized distribution) is a normal distributions (symmetric, unimodal) distribution characterized by:
  + Mean (center) of 0
  + Standard deviation (variability) of 1


## *z*-Distribution

```{r}
#| message: false
library(ggplot2)
library(ggprism)
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-4,4)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), color = "#FF2F92", linewidth = 1.2) + 
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Density", breaks = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Standardized Score", breaks = -5:5, limits= c(-5, 5)) +
  theme_prism() +
  annotate("text", x = 2.5, y = 0.35, label = "mu==0~~sigma==1", parse = TRUE, color = "#FF2F92", hjust = 0)
```


## Assumptions

- The values in the population can only take on 2 categories (e.g., "yes", "no").
- The values in the population are independent from each other. 
- Sample sizes for both groups is greater than 10

$$
n(\hat{p}) > 10 \qquad n(1-\hat{p}) > 10
$$


## Use R Studio

- Use the *z*-distribution to help us get our estimate for the variability in the sampling distribution
- Use functions in R Studio to also give us our *p*-value
- We will explore the entire hypothesis test process in today's activity!

## Summary

- There are many steps to the hypothesis test (overview on [Slide 9](#sec-slide-9)).
- Hypothesis tests help us test a claim while taking into account sampling variability.
- They provide one form of evidence to help answer a research question.
- <mark>We can use a *z*-distribution to help us conduct our test when we have categorical data.</mark>
