## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Define sampling variability.
- Explain how we can estimate uncertainty.
- Calculate an estimate for uncertainty using R Studio.


## Mini Activity

Get your pulse rate (beats per minute)

- Find your pulse
- I will time 1 minute on the clock
- Write down your pulse rate for that minute




## GOAL: Find the Average Pulse Rate for the Class

- We don’t have time for you all to get everyone's pulse .
- Collect a sample of 5 classmates' pulse rates.
- Calculate the average.

<!-- :::: {.columns} -->

<!-- ::: {.column width="50%"} -->
<!-- - These graphs allow us to see the distribution of the data. -->
<!-- - We want to know what the variable "looks like". -->

<!-- ::: -->

<!-- ::: {.column width="50%"} -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #| echo: false -->
<!-- gf_density(~price, data = lego) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ::: -->

## Did we all get the same mean?

- NO!
- Why not?
  + Sampling Variability!
  + Our mean pulse rate will vary from sample to sample


## How “different" are these estimates?

- Because of sampling variability we have uncertainty in our estimates.
- But how much uncertainty?
  + How different are these estimates?


## Distribution of Average Pulse Rates

Imagine if we plotted the distribution of averages we got. 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| message: false
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-3,3)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) + 
  ylab("") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Average Pulse Rate", breaks = NULL, limits= c(-3, 3)) +
  theme_void() +
  xlab("Average Pulse Rate")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-3,3)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 0.25)) + 
  ylab("") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Average Pulse Rate", breaks = NULL, limits= c(-3, 3)) +
  theme_void()
```

Which of these distributions has more uncertainty? Which has less?

## Estimating Uncertainty

- Once way to estimate the uncertainty is with the **standard error**.
- We obtain the standard error through a process called *bootstrapping*.
- We will explore that in the *Estimating Uncertainty* Activity.


## Simulation: Understanding Bootstrapping {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## Bootstrapping

- Bootstrapping mimics the process of sampling repeatedly from the population.
- From this, we can estimate the sampling variability.
- Bootstrap samples are generated by sampling with replacement from the original sample, using the same sample size.
- FINAL GOAL: Provide an estimate for uncertainty.



## Bootstrapping

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/07-01-bootstrapping-viz.png")
```


## Bootstrapping (cntd.)

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/07-01-bootstrapping-viz2.png")
```


## Bootstrap (cntd.)

- Once we have a bootstrap sample we can calculate the sample statistic of interest (in our color example it might be proportion of yellow).
- Complete the bootstrap sample process (draw a bootstrap sample and record the sample statistic of interest) MANY times.
- Once you are done you have a collection of MANY bootstrap samples.
- The standard deviation of this collection of bootstrap samples is your estimate for uncertainty! We call this the *standard error*.


## Estimating Uncertainty Activity {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## Summary

- Sampling variability (uncertainty) is the idea that sample estimates vary from sample to sample.
- We can estimate this uncertainty by calculating the standard error.


## Looking Ahead

- The data we are working with is from 2017.
- You are curious if the average pulse for U.S. adults has changed since 2017.
- You conduct your own study and get an average pulse of 74 beats per minute.
- But how can you determine if this is a difference due to sampling variability or a true difference? 
- We will explore that next class via hypothesis testing!
