## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Describe the purpose of a hypothesis test for comparing groups.
- List the steps of a hypothesis test.
- Describe a parametric approach to hypothesis testing for <mark>comparing two proportions</mark>.
- List the assumptions for using the *z*-distribution to test for a difference in proportions.


## Recall: Attribute Types

- When working with categorical data, the population proportion ($\pi$) has been our parameter of interest.
- Sometimes we have two groups (categorical variable) that we want to compare the proportion between.
  + The parameter of interest is now $\pi_{\text{Group 1}}-\pi_{\text{Group 2}}$.

  
  
  
## Purpose of Hypothesis Testing

To [test a claim]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} about a [population parameter]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}

- One Group
  + **RQ:** Is the proportion of people who vote Democrat different than 0.5?
- Two Groups 
  + **RQ:** Is there a difference in the proportion of people that vote democrat between those that live in rural and urban areas?


## Steps of Hypothesis Testing {#sec-slide-9}

1. Formulate a **research question**
2. Write your **hypotheses**
3. <mark>Find **sampling distribution** assuming the null hypothesis is true</mark>
4. **Compare** sample summary to the distribution under the null hypothesis
5. Get a **_p_-value**
6. Make a **decision** based on the *p*-value 
7. Communicate your **conclusion** in context


## Theoretical Distribution

- *z*-distribution
  + Same as for a single proportion
- This time we will compare the sample difference in proportions to the *z*-distribution


## Assumptions {.smaller}

- There are only two values the attribute can take on for each group (e.g., "yes" or "no")
- The values in both populations are independent from each other. (This is the case if we have a random sample.)
- Sample size in both groups is large enough:
  + $n_1(\hat{p_1}) > 10$
  + $n_1(1-\hat{p_1}) > 10$
  + $n_2(\hat{p_2}) > 10$
  + $n_2(1-\hat{p_2}) > 10$



## Research Question

Is there a difference the success rate of a new drug to cure a disease compared to a placebo?


## Data

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(educate)
trial = read_csv("data/drug-trial.csv")
```

| **Treatment**   | **Success** |
| --------------- | -------- |
| Placebo         | yes      |
| Drug            | yes      |
| Drug            | no       |
| &vellip;        | &vellip; |



## Statistical Hypotheses {.smaller}

- **Null hypothesis:** There is no difference in the success rate of a new drug to cure a disease compared to a placebo.
- **Alternative hypothesis:** There is a difference in the success rate of a new drug to cure a disease compared to a placebo.

$$
{\begin{split}
H_0: \pi_{\text{Drug}} &=    \pi_{\text{Placebo}}\\
H_A: \pi_{\text{Drug}} &\neq \pi_{\text{Placebo}}
\end{split}
} \quad \text{OR} \quad {\begin{split}
H_0: \pi_{\text{Drug}} - \pi_{\text{Placebo}} &= 0\\
H_A: \pi_{\text{Drug}} - \pi_{\text{Placebo}} &\neq 0
\end{split}
}
$$


## Sample Statistics

Get the sample proportion of success:

```{r}
#| echo: true
df_stats(~Success | Treatment, data = trial, "props")
```

<br />

Get the sample sizes:

```{r}
#| echo: true
df_stats(~Success | Treatment, data = trial, "counts")
```



## Sample Difference in Proportions â†’ *z*-value 

- The sample statistic is the difference in proportions
   + We will subtract the proportion of success for the treatment group from the proportion of success for the placebo group (ALPHABETICALLY)
   + Sample difference in proportions: $0.17 - 0.40 = -0.23$
- The sample difference of $-0.23$ gets converted to a *z*-value:  $z = -2.08$ (R Studio will do this for us!)
- This value gets evaluated in a *z*-distribution


## R Studio



```{r}
#| echo: true
my_z <- prop_test(
  ~Success == "yes" | Treatment, 
  data = trial,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  correct = FALSE
) 
```


## Compare Sample Difference to Null Distribution

```{r}
#| echo: true
plot_z_dist(my_z)
```


## *p*-Value and Decision

Since our *p*-value is less than 0.05 here...we will reject the null hypothesis.


```{r}
#| echo: true
z_results(my_z)
```


## Conclusion

We can conclude that there is likely a difference between the success rate of the new drug compared to the placebo.

## Summary

- Hypothesis tests help us test a claim while taking into account sampling variability.
- They provide one form of evidence to help answer a research question.
- We can use a *z*-distribution to help us conduct our test when we have two groups to compare on a categorical attribute.
