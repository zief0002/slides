```{r}

coffee = readr::read_csv("data/coffee-sales.csv")
lm.a = lm(coffee_sales ~ 1 + temperature, data = coffee)
```


## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Check assumptions for a linear model.


## Assumptions for a Linear Model

- **L** ---	Pattern is linear (plot your data)
- **I** ---	Observations are independent from each other (i.e., At a particular X value, one observation's Y value does not affect observations' Y values)
- **N** --- The outcome variable is normally distributed 
  + Some also add "no outliers"
- **E** ---	Equal variance
  + Variability in Y is constant at each X value (no fanning out of residuals on residual plot)



## Linearity

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6
gf_point(coffee_sales ~ temperature, data = coffee, size = 3, pch = 21, color = "black", fill = "#56B4E9") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Temperature", breaks = seq(from = -20, to =70, by = 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Coffee Sales", breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 650, by = 50)) +
  theme_bw()
```


## Independence

- Consider all the coffee sales at a particular temperature
- Reasonable to assume that one day's coffee sales does not affect another day's sales


## Normality

```{r}
gf_histogram(~coffee_sales, data = coffee, color = "black", fill = "#2CCEF6")
```


## Equal Variance

- Should see that the range of residuals is constant (about the same) at each X value

```{r}
#| message: false
# Get residuals
library(broom)
out = augment(lm.a)

# Residual plot
gf_point(
  .resid ~ temperature, data = out,
  xlab = "Temperature",
  ylab = "Residuals"
  )
```


## A Residual Plot Showing Unequal Variance

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/27-01-fanning.png")
```



## Residual Plot to Evaluate Linearity

- Random pattern around the line residual = 0
- Means your model is not systematically over or under-predicting

```{r}
gf_point(
  .resid ~ temperature, data = out,
  xlab = "Temperature",
  ylab = "Residuals"
  )
```


## A Residual Plot Showing Non-linearity

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/27-02-nonlinearity.png")
```


## Assumptions for Linear Regression Activity {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## Summary

- For hypothesis test results for regression to be valid, we need to meet the following assumptions:
  + Linearity
  + Independence
  + Normality
  + Equal variances
- The mnemonic LINE can be used to hep remember the assumptions.
