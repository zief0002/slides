## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Conduct a hypothesis test for a slope coefficient.
- Interpret results from a hypothesis test for a slope coefficient.


## Recall: Linear Regression Equation


$$
\hat{y} = \underbrace{\beta_0}_{\text{Intercept}} + \underbrace{\beta_1}_{\text{Slope}}(x)
$$

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6
gf_point(coffee_sales ~ temperature, data = coffee, size = 3, pch = 21, color = "black", fill = "#56B4E9") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Temperature", breaks = seq(from = -20, to =70, by = 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Coffee Sales", breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 650, by = 50)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "#CC79A7")
```


## *t*-Test for a Slope

- $H_0: \beta_1=0$
  + The slope (in the population) equals 0. (i.e., There is no linear relationship between X and Y.)

- $H_A: \beta_1\neq0$
  + The slope (in the population) does not equal 0. (i.e., There is a linear relationship between X and Y.)


## Using R Studio

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| class-output: "highlight numberLines"
#| output-line-numbers: "5"
# Fit regression model
lm.a = lm(coffee_sales ~ 1 + temperature, data = coffee)
# See results of hypothesis test (Need broom package)
tidy(lm.a)
```

## Summary

- If we want to determine if X is a statistically significant predictor of Y we can do a hypothesis test for the slope.
- A small *p*-value tells us that there is evidence the slope is different than 0 (i.e., X is a predictor of Y).
