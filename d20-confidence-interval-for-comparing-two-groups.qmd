## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Identify when to answer a research question with a confidence interval.
- Explain the need for creating a confidence interval to do statistical inference.
- <mark>Know how to calculate (by hand and using R Studio) and interpret a confidence interval for a difference in means and proportions.</mark>
- Explain how the confidence level we choose affects our interval.


## Confidence Intervals

- We have uncertainty in our sample estimates because of sampling variability (i.e., samples vary)
- We need something to quantify the uncertainty in our estimates.

â†’ Confidence Intervals


## Confidence Interval for a Difference in Means {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## Assumptions 

- The distribution of values in both population is normally distributed.
  + Note: If the sample size is greater than 30 in each group we can use the *t*-distribution without our sample being normally distributed (because of the Central Limit Theorem).
- The values in both populations are independent from each other.
- Both populations have the same variance (the larger variance not 4x larger than the smaller variance).


## Formula

- General CI formula: $\text{Estimate} \pm (t^* \times \text{SE})$
- Estimate is the difference in sample means
- SE comes from Table 19.1 in textbook


$$
\textrm{CI} = (\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2) \pm t*\sqrt{\frac{\text{SD}_{1}^2}{n_{1}} +\frac{\text{SD}_{2}^2}{n_{2} }}
$$


## Confidence Interval for a Difference in Proportions {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}



## Assumptions 

- The values in both populations can only take on 2 categories (e.g., "yes", "no").
- The values in the population are independent from each other. 
- Sample sizes for both groups is greater than 10

$$
\begin{split}
n_1(\hat{p}_1) > 10 &\qquad n_1(1-\hat{p}_1) > 10\\
n_2(\hat{p}_2) > 10 &\qquad n_2(1-\hat{p}_2) > 10
\end{split}
$$

## Formula

- General CI formula: $\text{Estimate} \pm (t^* \times \text{SE})$
- Estimate is the difference in sample proportions
- SE comes from Table 19.1 in textbook


$$
\text{CI} = (\hat{p}_{1} - \hat{p}_{2}) \pm z*\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p_1}(1-\hat{p_1})}{n_1} +\frac{\hat{p_2}(1-\hat{p_2})}{n_2} }
$$


<!-- ## Interpretation -->

<!-- - When interpreting a CI you need to include: -->
<!--   + <span style="color:#942192;">Confidence level</span> -->
<!--   + <span style="color:#0433FF;">Population parameter</span> -->
<!--   + <span style="color:#008F00;">Interval Estimate</span> -->

<!-- **Example:** We are <span style="color:#942192;">95% confident</span> that the <span style="color:#0433FF;">proportion of people that are left handed</span> is between <span style="color:#008F00;">0.08 and 0.12</span>. -->

## Summary

- For a research question asking for an estimate, the best way to answer is with a confidence interval.
- The confidence interval allows us to account for uncertainty by including sampling variability in our estimate of the parameter. 
- With a higher confidence level we expect a larger confidence interval (more uncertainty in the estimate).
