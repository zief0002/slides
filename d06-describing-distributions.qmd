## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Name and describe the three key features of a distribution.
- Identify and explain when to use the mean or median to describe the center of a distribution.
- Identify and explain when to use the standard deviation or IQR to describe the variability of a distribution.
- Describe distributions key features in the context of the data.

- We want to know what the variable "looks like".

```{r}

```


### Skewed Right

The tail is on the right.

```{r}
skewed_right <- data.frame(y = rbeta(10000,100,2))
skewed_right[1] <- skewed_right[1]*-1

gf_density(~y, data = skewed_right, xlab = "Variable Y")
```


### Skewed Left

The tail is on the left.

```{r}
skewed_right <- data.frame(y = rbeta(10000,100,2))
gf_density(~y, data = skewed_right, xlab = "Variable Y")

## Center

- A value in the distribution that is "typical"
- Often measured by the:
  + **Mean:** Average of all data points
  + **Median:** Middle value of the data (if put in numerical order)

## Variability

- A measure of how distinct the points in your dataset are
- Often measured by the:
  + **Range:** The distance between the smallest and largest data value
  + **Standard deviation:** A measure of the average distance each point is from the mean
  + **IQR:** The distance between the the 25th and 75th percentile values (i.e., middle 50% of the data)


## Describing Distributions Activity {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## Summary {.smaller}

- The three key features of a distribution
  + Shape: symmetric/skewed? Unimodal/bimodal?
  + Center: at what single point is most of the data?
  + Variability: what range best describes where the majority of the data falls?
- When to use the mean or median to describe the center of a distribution
  + If we have a skewed distribution we will use the median to describe the center
  + If we have a symmetric distribution we could use either mean or median, but the mean is the most often used
- When to use the standard deviation or IQR to describe the variability of a distribution
  + If we have a skewed distribution we will use the IQR to describe the variability 
  + If we have a symmetric distribution we could use either IQR or standard deviation, but typically we use the standard deviation
