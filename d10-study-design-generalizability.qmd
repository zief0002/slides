## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Describe the benefits of obtaining a random sample.



## Purpose of Hypothesis Testing

:::{.v-center-container}
To [test a claim]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} about a [population parameter]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}
:::


## Steps of Hypothesis Testing {#sec-slide-9}

1. Formulate a **research question**
2. Write your **hypotheses**
3. [Find **sampling distribution** assuming the null hypothesis is true]{.rn rn-type=highlight rn-multiline=true}
3. <mark>Find **sampling distribution** assuming the null hypothesis is true</mark>
4. **Compare** sample summary to the distribution under the null hypothesis
5. Get a **_p_-value**
6. Make a **decision** based on the *p*-value 
7. Communicate your **conclusion** in context

## Generalizing from a Study {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## How did we collect our sample?

- Ideally we want to generalize results from our population to more people than just our sample.
- How we collected our sample might affect our results.
  + **Example:** Sample people in the library about how much they study â†’ might not generalize to the whole campus

## Can You Generalize?

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/10-01-generalization.png")
```


## Summary

- Random samples provide unbiased estimates for the population.
- This allows us to generalize our findings from our sample to the population the sample was draw from.
