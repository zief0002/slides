## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Describe the benefits of obtaining a random sample.


## Generalizing from a Study {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## How did we collect our sample?

- Ideally we want to generalize results from our population to more people than just our sample.
- How we collected our sample might affect our results.
  + **Example:** Sample people in the library about how much they study â†’ might not generalize to the whole campus


## Bias

- How we sample might bias our results (we could under or over predict).
- The least biased way to collect a sample is via random sampling.
- You will explore this in an activity!

## Can You Generalize?

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/10-01-generalization.png")
```


## Summary

- Random samples provide unbiased estimates for the population.
- This allows us to generalize our findings from our sample to the population the sample was draw from.
