## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Describe the purpose of a hypothesis test.
- List the steps of a hypothesis test.



## Review

- **Parameter**: A population level summary of data
  + $\mu$: Population mean
  + $\pi$: Population proportion

- **Statistic**: A sample level summary of data
  + $\bar{x}$: Sample mean
  + $\hat{p}$: Sample proportion



## Test a Claim

In research we often want to test a claim:

- Is the true average body temperature really 98.6?
- Is 10% of the world left-handed?
- Is a new treatment more effective than an old treatment for a particular disease?


## How to Test a Claim

To test a claim we often start by getting a sample of data from our population of interest. We then summarize the sample data to evaluate the claim. But do we need to account for?

<br /><br />

SAMPLING VARIABILITY



## Mini Example Scenario

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/08-01-mini-scenario.png")
```


## Recap

What did we do on the last slide?

- Considered the "existing standard"
- Compared our sample to that "existing standard"
- Decided whether our sample evidence "fits" with the "existing standard"
- Did our sample evidence seem likely if that "existing standard" is true?

## Purpose of Hypothesis Testing

:::{.v-center-container}
To [test a claim]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} about a [population parameter]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}
:::


## Steps of Hypothesis Testing {#sec-slide-9}

1. Formulate a **research question**
2. Write your **hypotheses**
3. Find **sampling distribution** assuming the null hypothesis is true
4. **Compare** sample summary to the distribution under the null hypothesis
5. Get a **_p_-value**
6. Make a **decision** based on the *p*-value 
7. Communicate your **conclusion** in context


## Hypothesis Testing Example {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}


## Step 1: Research Question

:::{.v-center-container}
Are 10% of people left-handed?
:::


## Step 2: Hypotheses

<br />

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Null Hypothesis

Usually a statement of no effect, no difference, "status quo" (a statement of equality)

- The "dull" hypothesis
- The "no change" or "no difference" hypothesis
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Alternative Hypothesis

There is an effect or difference (a statement of inequality)

- The "exciting" hypothesis
- Often aligns with the researcher's hypothesis about an effect
:::

::::



## Example Hypotheses

<span style="color:#970E53;">**Null hypothesis**</span> (always uses an = sign)

$$
H_0:  \underbrace{\pi}_{\mathrm{Population~parameter\\(proportion~in~this~case)}} = \underbrace{0.10}_{\mathrm{Hypothesized~value}}
$$

<span style="color:#006C65;">**Alternative hypothesis**</span> (sign based on the research question)

$$
H_A: \pi \neq 0.10
$$

## Example Hypotheses (cntd.)

In other cases the alternative might be:

- $H_A: \pi < 0.1$
- $H_A: \pi > 0.1$


## Step 3: Sampling Distribution {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Referred to as a **sampling distribution** and is obtained by
  + Simulation (next class)
  + Mathematical formula (after next class)

- Allows us to estimate the sampling variability we expect given our sample
- Centered at the null hypothesized value
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| message: false
library(ggplot2)
library(ggprism)

ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(.025,.175)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0.1, sd = .025)) + 
  ylab("") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Sample Proportion", breaks = c(.05, 0.1, .15)) +
  theme_prism()
```

:::

::::


## Step 4: Compare Sample Statistic

```{r}
#| message: false
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(.025,.175)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0.1, sd = .025)) + 
  ylab("") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Sample Proportion", breaks = c(.05, 0.1, .15)) +
  theme_prism() +
  geom_segment(x = 0.13, xend = 0.13, y = -1, yend = 14, color = "#FF2F92") +
  annotate("text", x = 0.13, y = 15, label = "hat(p)==0.13", parse = TRUE, color = "#FF2F92")
```


## Step 5: *p*-Value

- Calculated based on the sampling distribution (based on the null hypothesis)
- Tells us how likely our sample statistic is, given the null hypothesis is true
- Compared to a *significance level* or alpha-value (typically $\alpha = 0.05$)


## Step 6: Decision

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figs/08-02-decision-criteria.png")
```


## Step 7: Conclusion

- If we REJECT the null hypothesis → we conclude in favor of the alternative hypothesis (often called "statistical significance," although a better term may be "statistical discernibility")
- If we DO NOT REJECT the null hypothesis → we conclude there is NOT enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis


## Example Conclusion

Recall the research question (Are 10% of people left-handed?) and statistcal hypotheses:

$$
\begin{split}
H_0: \pi &= 0.10 \\
H_A: \pi &\neq 0.10
\end{split}
$$

- Suppose our *p*-value was 0.230.
- Since this is larger then 0.05 (our alpha value):
  + We decide to not reject the null hypothesis.
  + There is NOT enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of people who are left-handed is different from 0.10.

## Summary

- There are many steps to the hypothesis test (overview on [Slide 9](#sec-slide-9)).
- Hypothesis tests help us test a claim while taking into account sampling variability.
- They provide one form of evidence to help answer a research question.
