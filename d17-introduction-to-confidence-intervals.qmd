## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Identify when to answer a research question with a confidence interval.
- Explain the need for creating a confidence interval to do statistical inference.
- Know how to calculate a confidence interval by hand and using R Studio.
- Interpret a confidence interval.


## Confidence Intervals

- We have uncertainty in our sample estimates because of sampling variability (i.e., samples vary)
- We need something to quantify the uncertainty in our estimates.

â†’ Confidence Intervals


  
  
  
## Terminology

- **Standard Deviation (SD):** Average distance from the mean, where each case in the data is an individual value.
- **Standard Error (SE):** Standard deviation for a sampling distribution (where each case in the sampling distribution is a statistic).



## Terminology (cntd.)

- 95% Confidence Interval

$$
95\%~\text{CI} = \text{Sample Statistic} \pm \underbrace{(2 \times SE)}_{\text{Margin of Error}} 
$$
- To get a confidence interval, we add and subtract a specified number of standard errors from the sample statistic.
- Margin of error quantifies the amount of uncertainty (sampling error due to variation from sample-to-sample).

```


## Interpretation

- When interpreting a CI you need to include:
  + <span style="color:#942192;">Confidence level</span>
  + <span style="color:#0433FF;">Population parameter</span>
  + <span style="color:#008F00;">Interval Estimate</span>

**Example:** We are <span style="color:#942192;">95% confident</span> that the <span style="color:#0433FF;">average price of a single-family house near the University of Minnesota</span> is between <span style="color:#008F00;">\$348K and \$461K</span>.

## Summary

- For a research question asking for an estimate, the best way to answer is with a confidence interval.
- The confidence interval allows us to account for uncertainty by including sampling variability in our estimate of the parameter.
